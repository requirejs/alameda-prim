#alameda-prim

The [alameda](https://github.com/requirejs/alameda) AMD module loader that includes a private promise shim if the JS environment does not provide one. This is mainly to support using alameda in IE 10 and 11. If that is not a requirement for your project, then use alameda.

This project is no longer updated. It is at alameda version 1.1.2. Alameda version 1.3.0 uses [Object.create](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/#test-Object.create), which may not fit with the goals of this project to be for older browsers.
